# LIMO

The matlab code of the LIMO algorithm proposed in our ICML'17 paper "A Unified View of Multi-Label Performance Measures"

# Run

Run the `demo.m` in MATLAB, LIMO will run as its default parameters on sample datasets.

[LibSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) is needed. MATLAB functions named `svmtrain` and `svmpredict` should be included in path.

Some sample datasets and performance measure evaluation codes are contained. You may find the evaluation codes are useful for your own multi-label research.
